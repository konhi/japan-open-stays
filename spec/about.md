## About Japanese "Weekly Mansions"

**Weekly mansions** in Japan are small apartments you can rent for a week or more. They already have furniture, kitchen, and everything you need.

They are **noticably cheaper** than Airbnb or hotels if you want to stay in Japan for longer.

The most popular website for finding mansions like this is: https://www.weekly-mansion.com

## Problems

1. User Experience of these websites is terrible.

- No english UI.
- Doesn't allow you to see all stays in a location, e.g. Tokyo. You need to select by town.
- No map UI like booking/airbnb.

2. Information is hard to process. It shows 120,000 yen per month + many different fees (utilities, management, cleaning, bedding, deposit, common, insurance), so total is 200,000 yen per month. It should be straight for user so they can filter out in their budget. We can use AI to get total for 1 month, 2 month, 3 month, etc.
3. No possibility to easily compare, save, bookmark, etc. I want to make it simple to pick the single best place.

## Stack

1. Apify & Crawlee & AI for scraping websites
2. Next.js for front-end
3. AWS with IaaC
